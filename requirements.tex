\section{Requirements and Charecteristics of MEC}  \label{requirements}

Since MEC brings huge benefits to both mobile operators and the end users, enabling this tecnology requires the following requirements and charecteristics.

\begin{itemize}

\item \textit{\textit{Low latency}}: Since the cloud services are deployed in the proximity to the end users, MEC offers the low processing delay that will be beneficial to many use cases such as AR/VR and streaming applications.

\item \textit{\textit{Intensive computation}}: computation offloading, traffic congestion

\item \textit{\textit{High mobility}}: live migration

\end{itemize}
